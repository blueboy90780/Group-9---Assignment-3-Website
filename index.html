    <h1>3. Project Description</h1>
    <h2>3.1 Overview</h2>
    <h3>3.2 Topic</h3>
    <p>Our group aims to develop an app called "Piggy Bank" that will revolutionise budget management and finances for those who struggle to do it themselves. The main purpose of this app is to shape a better financial lifestyle for the users. "Piggy Bank" will offer an entire system by merging critical financial software elements with AI-powered functionality. The application will deliver individualised advice to users by evaluating prior transaction records, assisting them in identifying areas where they may decrease costs and save money. In creating this mobile financial application, our team hopes that it can help users change to a more financially healthy lifestyle, as well as assisting them in reaching their desired financial goals.</p>
    <h3>3.3 Motivation</h3>
    <p>The "Piggy Bank" idea was inspired by the rising need to solve the financial issues that young people, particularly university students and recent graduates are confronting. Because of the prevalence of overspending and poor budget management among this group, a solution that can give guidance and help in establishing a financially healthy lifestyle is required.
<br><br>
This project is important and interesting because it tackles a real-world problem that affects a significant portion of the population. It adheres to current IT trends by utilising sophisticated technologies such as artificial intelligence and mobile applications to deliver a user-friendly and accessible solution. With the advent of digital banking, mobile payments, and subscription-based services, there is an increased need for applications that assist users in navigating their financial environment and gaining control over their spending patterns. "Piggy Bank" addresses these tendencies by combining transaction tracking, subscription management, and AI-powered recommendations into a single platform.
<br><br>
Working on this project would display a number of desirable characteristics to a potential employer. For starters, it demonstrates a good awareness of user needs as well as the capacity to provide realistic solutions to those demands. It displays expertise in designing mobile applications and incorporating AI functions, both of which are in great demand in today's work market. Working on "Piggy Bank" also demonstrates a dedication to social impact and financial education, since it strives to enhance the financial well-being of young people. It exhibits the ability to work on complicated projects, communicate with interdisciplinary teams, and provide a user-centric solution that is current with IT trends.
</p>
    <h3>3.4 Landscape</h3>
    <p> Upon research, we shortlisted a few apps that offer the same ideas as our project, which are: Mint, YNAB (You Need a Budget), Personal Capital, and PocketGuard, and upon further research, Mint was considered our biggest competitor. It offers comprehensive budgeting tools, expense tracking, bill reminders, and goal-setting features.
    <br><br>
Piggy Bank would join a congested market populated by established firms. It distinguishes itself, however, with the incorporation of AI-powered services. While some existing programs may provide basic recommendations based on spending habits, Piggy Bank wants to use AI to provide more tailored and actionable advice. It may evaluate past transaction data, identify areas of expenditure or possible savings, and provide consumers with tailored recommendations not only based on their expenditure pattern but also on other economic  situations (Such as economic depression). This AI-powered function distinguishes Piggy Bank from competitors, allowing it to provide a more personalised and smarter money management experience.
<br><br>
Another factor from which we can benefit is that almost every financial application comes with a one-time purchase or subscription-based service to access more features. However, we want to make Piggy Bank a free app so that it can be accessed by everyone. We will introduce ads on our app by partnering with different advertisers. Revenue will be generated based on the number of ad impressions (views) or clicks generated by users. The more popular the app and the higher the user engagement, the more potential revenue it can generate from ads.

    <h1>Detaild Description</h1>
    <h2>3.5.1 Aims</h2>
    <h2>3.5.2 Plans and Progress</h2>
    <h2>3.5.3 Roles</h2>
    <h2>3.5.4 Scope and Limits</h2>
    
    <h2>3.5.5 Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <p>There are numerous softwares, tools and technologies that will be used throughout the entire lifecycle of the entire app (from inception, design, development to production) each with their own purpose uniquely catered for a specific stage within the product life cycle. From the inception stage, we would need to plan out the application’s architecture for both back end and front end. This requires use of diagram tools such as draw.io and UML tools for designing entity relationship models which will later be developed into a database. After having planned out the application architecture, the team will then need to consider designing how the front end will look to the end user. This will require the use of design tools such as Figma that is uniquely catered for this purpose. 
<br><br>
After designing comes the development stage, there are several facets of the development stage each requiring their own toolset. For starters, the team will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to work with in order to develop the application. The application should be accessible to both IOS and Android users, so using a cross platform technology framework such as Flutter will be used to develop the application whilst being able to maintain a single codebase. Otherwise, another approach is to use Kotlin for Android development and Swift for IOS development. The team would then need to interact with banking softwares and digital wallets to work with their APIs in order to create an integration between the app and the software. 
<br><br>
There are several features of the app that heavily relies on artificial intelligence in order to perform actions such as suggesting a personalised budget plan as described in the Overview section. To develop AI capabilities, the team will use a specific library called TensorFlow which is an AI library designed specifically for mobile application, making it uniquely suitable for the purpose of our application. Finally, the app also needs to send frequent push notifications for features such as reminding user’s of an upcoming recurring subscription. These reminders will be achieved using Amazon SNS to automate the process of sending push notifications at predefined time and under proper context.
<br><br>
Finally, there’s tools related to the collaboration aspect of the development stage as well. This app requires the collaborative effort of multiple people considering the scale and features involved in this app. First of all, a repository hosting service would be required so the team will make use of Github. CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Development) tools are also needed to ensure a smooth developmental workflow, services such as CircleCI will be used for this purpose.
<br><br>
Once the application has been successfully developed, it needs to be made available to the public such that they can access it over a network. This is made possible by deploying the application to a cloud hosted provider such as AWS (Amazon Web  Service), doing this also requires the application code to use AWS respective SDK (Software Development Kit) which is another tool that would be included in the developmental stage. Once deployed, a tool called “Sentry” will be used to monitor the application performance and receive reports of any errors that may arise.
<br><br>
Regarding the licence, there were several softwares mentioned in this section that required paid licence such as an IDE to develop the application. The team will be using Jetbrains proprietary suite of IDEs so a commercial licence will be needed. Other proprietary software such as Figma, CircleCI, Sentry, Amazon SNS and Github Enterprise (for hosting code repository) will also require the need of a commercial licence. Other than that, this project uses open-source tools (such as draw.io) that doesn’t require any commercial licence.
<br><br>
No extra hardware is needed beyond a standard laptop for application development and a phone to run and test the application on.</p>
    <h2>3.5.6 Testing</h2>
    <p>There’s going to be technical tests to ensure that the application is working as intended. Such tests include unit testing and integration testing. Unit testing is the testing of individual methods and functions of classes whilst integration test is more concerned with testing if the module or services works well together. The project will also include user testing to gather feedback about the product and see how it fares up against other products within the same market. To gather candidates for the product, we will issue an announcement to local communities such as RMIT Vietnam Facebook with a small monetary incentive for those who agree to participate in the survey. Approximately around 20 candidates will be selected for the survey, separated into 2 groups, those who study IT and those who don’t study IT. The reason for this separation is to observe how a non-technical user would interact with the app and see if they would find any aspect of the app difficult to use. Such interaction will be used as feedback in order to improve the UI of the app to make it more user friendly to a larger audience.
<br><br>
We can verify that the test is a success if most of the candidates give out highly positive reviews about our application. This indicates that the application has been well made up to the proper standard. Regarding the technical test, if the application passes the unit tests and integration tests without throwing any errors then it would be considered a successful test. The application has to pass both of these tests in order to be determined a successful application.</p>
